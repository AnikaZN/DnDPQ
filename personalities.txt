and props

careful deliberation.

superiority.

- Occasionally allow a smart plan to grant an easy win for the players
- Create NPCs with complex motives

when their characters are heavily invested in an unfolding story, and they
enjoy encounters that are tied to and expand an overarching plot.
- Make sure their characters' actions help steer future events
- Give NPCs ideals, bonds, and flaws that the adventurers can exploit
- When my character's background helps shape the story of the campaign.
- Encounters that advance the story in some way.
